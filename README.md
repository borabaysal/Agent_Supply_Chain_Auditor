# Agent Supply-Chain Auditor (`asca`)

A zero-dependency CLI for people who **self-host AI agents** (Hermes Agent, Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, any MCP client). It audits the setup for supply-chain risk, writes a **PASS/FAIL report**, and can **alert you on Telegram**.

```
$ asca --repos ~/Projects --telegram fail --env-file ~/.hermes/.env
asca 0.1.0: FAIL (fail-on high)
  critical=1  high=2  medium=1  low=5  info=2  suppressed=0
  [CRITICAL] core.fsmonitor names a program git runs on every index refresh
      ~/Projects/downloaded-repo/.git/config:3
  [HIGH] Hub skill `polymarket-weather-trader` is not pinned to a commit
      ~/.hermes/skills/.hub/lock.json#installed.polymarket-weather-trader
  ...
  report: asca-report.md  (asca-report.json)
```

## What it checks

| Category | Checks |
|---|---|
| **Pinning** | Hermes Skills Hub installs with no upstream commit pin · skill taps that track a branch · plugins checked out on a moving branch · MCP servers launched with `npx`/`bunx`/`uvx`/`pipx` without an exact version · `docker run` images without `@sha256:` digest · `git+https://` installs without a commit SHA · skills that tell the agent to `curl … \| sh` · remote MCP servers (reported as *info*, since they can't be pinned) |
| **Repo config** (GitSpawn) | `core.fsmonitor` set to a program (**critical**, see [CVE-2026-71963](https://www.rapid7.com/db/vulnerabilities/cve-2026-71963/) for Hermes, CVE-2026-19592 for Codex, CVE-2026-72718 for goose), plus every other git key that names a program: `core.hooksPath`, `core.sshCommand`, `core.askPass`, `core.pager`/`pager.*`, `core.editor`, `diff.external`, `diff.*.textconv`, `filter.*.{clean,smudge,process}`, `merge.*.driver`, `credential.helper` (non-builtin), `protocol.ext.allow`, `include.path`/`includeIf`, `!` aliases, `gpg.program` · active (non-`.sample`) git hooks · linked worktrees/submodules (`.git` files) · project `.mcp.json` / `.cursor/mcp.json` that ship with a repo |
| **Exposed keys** | Literal API keys in agent config, cron jobs, memories, skills, plugins, scripts and MCP `env`/`headers` (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, GitHub, Slack, Telegram, AWS, Google, Stripe, HF, wallet private keys, PEM keys, generic `api_key=` assignments) · tokens embedded in git remote URLs and MCP URLs · credential files (`.env`, `auth.json`, `.git-credentials`, `config.yaml`, MCP OAuth tokens) readable by group/other |
| **Integrity** | Hub skills whose on-disk content no longer matches the install-time hash (same algorithm as Hermes' Skills Guard) · skills installed despite a non-`safe` scanner verdict · Hermes Agent versions inside a known-vulnerable range |

### Safety properties of the auditor itself

- **It never runs `git`.** Running `git status` inside a hostile repo is exactly how GitSpawn fires, so `.git/config` is parsed as text. A test (`test_never_invokes_git`) blocks process spawning and asserts the payload never runs.
- **It never prints secrets.** Findings show a 4-char prefix, the length, and a short SHA-256 tag, so you can tell *which* key leaked without the report becoming a leak itself. Reports are written `0600`.
- **It fails closed.** An unparseable lock file or config produces a HIGH `scanner.parse-error` finding instead of a silent pass.
- **It has no dependencies.** Python ≥3.10 stdlib only. YAML is read by a small built-in parser (PyYAML's `safe_load` is used instead if it happens to be installed). The built-in parser is differential-tested against PyYAML on real Hermes configs and skill front-matter.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/borabaysal/Agent_Supply_Chain_Auditor && cd Agent_Supply_Chain_Auditor
python3 -m asca --help                 # run in place, no install needed
# or
uv tool install .   # / pipx install .   -> `asca` on PATH
```

## Usage

```bash
asca                                   # Hermes home ($HERMES_HOME or ~/.hermes) + MCP client configs + global git config
asca --repos ~/Projects --repos ~/Downloads     # also audit every git repo under these dirs (4 levels deep)
asca --mcp-config ./some/mcp.json      # extra MCP client config
asca --fail-on critical                # threshold: info|low|medium|high|critical (default high)
asca -o reports/2026-10-05             # writes reports/2026-10-05.md and .json
asca --format json                     # machine-readable on stdout
```

Exit codes: `0` PASS · `1` FAIL · `2` usage/config/alert-delivery error.

### Accepting a risk (baseline)

```bash
asca --write-baseline asca-baseline.json   # snapshot current fingerprints
# edit the "reason" fields, then:
asca --baseline asca-baseline.json         # suppressed findings are listed but don't fail
```

Fingerprints are `sha256(rule, location, subject)`, so a *new* problem in the same file still fails.

### Telegram alerts

```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...   # or ASCA_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=...     # or ASCA_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID / TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL / --telegram-chat
asca --telegram fail            # alert only on FAIL
asca --telegram change          # alert when PASS/FAIL or the failing set changes vs the previous report
asca --telegram always
asca --env-file ~/.hermes/.env --telegram fail   # reuse the Hermes gateway's bot settings
```

The alert lists counts, up to 8 failing findings, and the report path. It never includes secret material.

### Scheduling

```cron
# daily 07:00, alert only when something changes
0 7 * * * cd /path/to/Agent_Supply_Chain_Auditor && python3 -m asca --repos ~/Projects -o ~/asca/latest --telegram change --env-file ~/.hermes/.env --format none
```

## Limits (MVP)

- Hub "pinning" means an upstream **commit** is recorded. Hermes' lock currently stores only a content hash, so every community hub skill is reported until Hermes records commits or you vendor skills into a repo you control.
- Secret detection is pattern-based. It catches common providers and obvious assignments, not every possible secret.
- Remote (URL) MCP servers can't be pinned and are reported as `info`.
- `global core.fsmonitor=false` is suggested as defence in depth only. A repo-local value still overrides it.
- The version advisory table is built in (`asca/hermes.py: HERMES_ADVISORIES`); update it as new advisories land.
